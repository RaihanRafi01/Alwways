Interact with AI through natural language chat to build storylines based on your answers. The app generates episode-specific sub-questions to dig deeper into each narrative point.

### 📖 Episode-Based Book Creation

Each book contains multiple episodes, and each episode starts with a core question. After user responses, the AI validates the input and generates relevant sub-questions to enhance the storytelling.

### 🧠 AI Validation & Sub-question Generation

AI evaluates user responses, validates them, and generates follow-up questions to enhance detail, character depth, or plot points.

### ✍️ Edit, Customize, and Personalize

After generating episodes or the full book, you can edit the content, add or change book/episode covers, and refine your storytelling style.

### 📤 Export Full Books

Export completed stories or individual episodes in readable formats for sharing, printing, or publishing.
